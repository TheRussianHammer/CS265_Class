Q7:
When the two files are diffed there are several things consisting of the
output. For each line difference; first the range of line numbers that
differ are printed out using a format of "a1,a2cb1,b2", where "a1,a2"
represents the line number range in the first file, and "b1,b2" represents
the line number range of the second file. It follows this format only if
there are consecutive line changes, otherwise "a1cb1" is printed where "a1"
represents a line number in the first file, and "b1" represents a line
number in the second file. Next, all of the lines within the first files
line range are printed out, followed by a seperator and all of second files
line within the line range. This pattern is repeated for all differences
between both files.
