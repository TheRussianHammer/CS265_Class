Q 1.1:
lines 1 and 2 seem fine, but not really necessary. 
line 4 variables "ch" is too vague, and "BOF" is non descriptive.
line 5 variable is poorly formated with a dash in it/

Q 1.2:
int smaller(char *s, char *t){
	return strcmp(s,t) < 1
}

Q 1.3:
if disk space allocated for file is successful... do something

Q 1.4:
if ( c != 'y' && c != 'Y' )
	return;

if (length > BUFSIZE)
	length = BUFSIZE;

quote = (*line == '"');

bit = (val & 1) == 1;

Q 1.5:
the function "read" accepts an int pointer as a parameter, but a variable
adress is passed as a parameter in line 6 rather than a pointer.

Q 1.6
1 2

Q 1.7:
switch(1){
case istty(stdin):
case istty(stdout):
case istty(stderr): break;
default: return (0);
}

return retval;

for (k = 0; k < 5; k++){
	x += dx;
	scanf("%lf", &dx);
}

Q 1.8:
if this was a boolean function, it may never return a boolean value if the
conditional within the look never evaluates to true.

for (int count = 0; count < total; count++){
	if ( this.getName(count) == nametable.userName()){
		return (true);
	}
}
return (false);

Q 1.9:
missing parenthesis around the rest of the statement so that it returns a
boolean. Varaible 'c' is referenced twice in macro, which could lead to it
being evaluated twice.

#define ISDIGIT(c) (((c >= '0') && (c <= '9')) ? 1 : 0)

Q 1.10
redefine all constants as variables rather than macros.

const double FTZMETER = .3048;
etc.

Q 1.11:
function comment should be above actual function

comment is wrong. If statement checks for 'n' being within a bound, or if it
is uneven. Comment is not really needed regardless. 

First comment is not necessary as it is essentially the same as the function
name. The comments within the actual function are not necessary as the
purpose of the commented lines are obvious.
