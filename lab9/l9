Q1:
There was a seg fault. A new file called "core" was generated.

Q2:
The program failed in the the "inTable" function, which is called in "main"
which causes "main" to fail as well.

Q3:
	a) There was a bug on line 7. Changing scanf( "%d", n ) to scan( "%d", &n)

	b) The bug is rather apparent when running, as values "Pi" and "n" are
		flip-flopped. Changing printf("Pi=%d, n=%f\n", pi, n); to
		printf("Pi=%f, n=%d\n", pi, n); should fix it.

	c)The problem exists within the while loop, where the array "st" is
		never indexed at zero. The solution would be to increment "numLines"
		after indexing the array instead of before.

	d) There is a seg fault when scanning for user input. This is fixed by
		replacing the sceond paramter in the scanf function with the integer "n"
		adress "&n". 
	e)The error lies in the quicksort. The problem is that the pivot is not
		moved to the first position in quicksortBug like it is in quicksort. This
		is solve with swap(v,0,rand() % n); before the for loop, and an
		assertion of assert((last >= 0) && (last< n)).
Q4:
The compiler cannot catch it as the icmp function is passed in by reference. 

Q5:
Segmentation fault
